          Sometimes the process of learning can get overwhelming. Thereâ€™s so
          much to learn, and not enough time to devote to really diving in. When
          I get in a situation where I feel like giving up, or like Iâ€™ll never
          be able to learn what I want to learn in the time I have, it can help
          to turn to some outside inspiration.
